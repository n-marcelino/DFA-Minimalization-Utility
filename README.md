# DFA Minimization Utility

The DFA Minimization Utility is a browser-based tool for learning Automata Theory, specifically DFA. It makes use of transition tables in order to generate the equivalent DFA with the minimal amount of states.

Partitioning method was used to optimize DFA. You can view the partitions and equivalence classes through the console on  your browser. User manual can be accessed through documentations provided in the link below.
